#+title: OI 1 Year Plan
* 1 Year Plan
** 1y Goals Summary
*** Overall Objectives
- Provide data and insights to fleet leadership on:
  + game mechanics (for use in development of SOPs and TTPs etc, as needed for specific operations)
  + org member metrics (member retention, engagement, etc)
  + ingame intelligence (activities, contacts, etc of players ingame)
  + out-of-game intelligence (activities/relationships of other orgs, competitor analysis, threat assessment/intervention)
- Build intelligence-related tools to enhance fleet capabilities
- Maintain KISS
*** Recruitment Goals
- 1-3 additional competent, motivated, willing-to-learn members by 2025
*** Missions/Ops planned
-
- ongoing and/or repeating training/development and admin-focused missions monthly
- see [[*Missions/operations planned]]

** Training and Development
*** Plans to train and develop ONI members
- run minimum 1 training event per month, duplicated (or recorded) if availability is split
- create and maintain reference material for async reference
*** Planned resources/support for skill/knowledge acquisition
- ONI internal wiki/graph
- internal text channels/forum pages
*** Certs/qualifications?
- TBD during Q1
*** Skill/knowledge outcome goals
- experiment design
- hypothesis testing
- personnel analytics
- dataviz and dashboarding
- more TBD as encountered

** Operational Procedures
*** SOPs to be developed
**** intel gathering (Q1)
- checklists/templates for different types of intelligence/data
- ethics and ROE with sensitive data
- guidelines for when/how tasks should be passed off to Recon
**** analysis (Q1)
- as follow-on with data collected by ONI (primary)
- flowchart/checklist for analysis type and requirements
- determining when conclusive insights are possible vs more data is needed
**** dissemination (Q2)
- tie-in to INFOSEC system
- timeline
- writing guidelines
  + technical language
  + clarity and concision
- templates for different INFOSEC levels
- templates for non-text products (imagery etc)
****  INFOSEC system for determining and securing sensitive intel (Q1)
- set security levels
- flowchart/checklist for determining INFOSEC level
*** communication (tools/platforms)
**** within ONI
- see [[*Github (Q1)]]
**** RFI flow development
- see [[*RFI Submission (Q1)]]
**** between ONI and other units
- TBD during Q1

** Missions/Operations
*** ONI engaging in training or simulated exercises?
- TBD during Q1
*** real or potential threats and associated plans
**** Orgs/players (Q1)
- catalogue known org and individual threats
- produce recurring plans to discover and track threats
*** Missions/operations planned
**** 

** Technology and Tool Development
*** Tool development plans
**** internal to ONI
***** Github (Q1)
- task/project tracking
- geared toward ONI members (clarity/specificity over brevity)
**** for fleet-wide use
***** RFI Submission (Q1)
- discord bot app command
***** RFI search (Q2)
- to avoid duplication when submitting
***** current intel repository (Q3?)
- wiki or other graph

** Logistics and Budgeting
*** estimation of ONI budget needs (aUEC and human hours)
**** aUEC (tracked roughly)
- roughly 10-15 million *per patch*
- almost certainly covered by individual members unless typical gameplay income changes significantly
**** Human Hours (not currently tracked)
- 5-50 per week, split between members, weighted toward leadership

** Review and Assessment
*** How often will the 1y plan's progress be assessed?
- Assessed monthly at end of month
*** How will success be measured?
- Projects completed in assigned quarter
- ONI keeping up with fleet needs (backlog size staying stable)
*** How much adjustment to the plan will be permitted at the time of assessment, to deal with progress and changing circumstances?
- Projects may be moved within quarters as needed
- Delaying projects to a future quarter should be avoided (discuss w/ fleetcom)
